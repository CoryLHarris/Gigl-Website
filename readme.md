# Welcome to Gigl!
Have an event coming up and need talent? Gigl is a platform that connects clients to local freelancers such as photographers, bartenders, artists, and entertainers. Our website allows clients to post upcoming gigs and select a performer that meets their needs. It also allows talented peformers to create a profile, view gigs in their area, and apply for them! 

A team of us software engineers were asked by a client to build the Gigl website. We received feedback throughout the iterative build process to launch quickly and efficiently. 

We chose a monolithic architecture. Herein we have summarized the user stories built, technology stack utilized, how to launch the site, our work flow and ticketing approach, and team.

# Work Flow and Ticketing
## Work Flow
We followed a Git workflow to ensure work is accomplished in a consistent and productive manner.

## Ticketing
For ticketing and allocation of work, we followed an agile methodology. We created tickets in Trello with four basic states: 
- Open Items - work that has not been started
- In Progress - work that is actively being looked at by the team
- Code Review - work that is completed
- Done - work that is completely finished and meets the team's definition of done
